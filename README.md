array processing programs (windows forms)
Develop an application that allows you to perform the provided operations for processing the entered one-dimensional array:
- determining the sum of array elements;
- determination of the average value of the array elements;
– determination of the number and value of the minimum element of the array – - determination of the number and value of the maximum element of the array; - output of even values of the array elements;
- output of odd values of array elements;
- sort array elements in ascending order;
- sort array elements in descending order.
The application provides for the possibility of entering a one-dimensional array in three ways:
- generating an array with a given number of random integers evenly distributed in a given range;
– input from an existing text file (with the ability to specify the name of this file) with automatic detection of the number of elements to be entered; - input of the original array from the keyboard into the text field or
add / remove elements of an existing array.
Implement the ability to save the source array and the results of its processing in a text file. At the same time, when saving the results of several operations in a single file sequentially (using the append method), the source array should be output only when saving the result of the first operation
on the specified array.
All erroneous situations should be handled correctly,
and appropriate messages should be issued if necessary.
